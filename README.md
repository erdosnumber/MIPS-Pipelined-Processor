# MIPS Processor
This code simulates the state of registers and changes in memory after every clock cycle of a processor based on mips architecture while it executes a mips program. Created as part of Semester 4 course COL216 (Computer Architecture).

## Files
- `5stage.hpp` contains the implementation of a pipelined processor without bypassing.
- `5stage_bypass.hpp` contains the implementation of a pipelined processor with bypassing.
- `sample.asm` contains a sample mips program that can be run on the processor.
- `input.asm` should contain the mips program for which the simulation needs to be run.
